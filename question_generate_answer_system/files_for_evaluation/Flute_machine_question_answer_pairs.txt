Q: Why is a police whistle very wide for its pitch?
A: A police whistle is very wide for its pitch because it is designed to be loud and easily heard over a long distance. The whistle's wide mouthpiece allows for a larger air stream, which increases the volume of the sound produced. Additionally, the whistle's pitch is intentionally lower than that of a typical flute, making it easier to hear and distinguish from other sounds.
