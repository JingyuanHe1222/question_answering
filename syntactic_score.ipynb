      "article:  Turkish_language    Turkish (  IPA  ) is spoken as a first language by over 63 million people worldwide,    making it the most commonly spoken of the Turkic languages.  Its speakers are located predominantly in Turkey and Cyprus, with smaller groups in Iraq, Greece, Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania and other parts of Eastern Europe. Turkish is also spoken by several million immigrants in Western Europe, particularly in Germany.  The roots of the language can be traced to Central Asia, with the first written records dating back nearly 1,200 years. To the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatürk's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman script was replaced with a phonetic variant of the Latin alphabet. Concurrently, the newly founded Turkish Language Association initiated a drive to reform the language by removing Persian and Arabic loanwords in favor of native variants and coinages from Turkic roots.  The distinctive characteristics of Turkish are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is Subject Object Verb. Turkish has a T-V distinction: second-person plural forms can be used for individuals as a sign of respect. Turkish also has no noun classes or grammatical gender.     Turkish is a member of the Turkish, or Western, subgroup of the Oghuz languages, which includes Gagauz and Azeri. The Oghuz languages form the Southwestern subgroup of the Turkic languages, a language family comprising some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia. and Siberia.  Some linguists believe the Turkic languages to be a part of a larger Altaic language family.    About 40% of all speakers of Turkic languages are native Turkish speakers. Katzner  The characteristic features of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, and lack of grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family and the Altaic languages.  There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Turkish and the other Oghuz languages, including Azeri, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish.  Old Turkic inscription with the Orkhon script (c. 8th century). Kyzyl, Russia     The earliest known Turkic inscriptions are the two monumental Orkhon inscriptions. They reside in modern Mongolia and were erected in honour of the prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khan and dating back to some time between 732 and 735, constitute another important early record. After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the Orkhon Valley between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the Old Turkic language written using the Orkhon script, which has also been referred to as \"Turkic runes\" or \"runiform\" due to an external similarity to the Germanic runic alphabets. Ishjatms  With the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across Central Asia, covering a vast geographical region stretching from Siberia to Europe and the Mediterranean. The Seljuqs of the Oghuz Turks, in particular, brought their language, Oghuz Turkic—the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language—into Anatolia during the 11th century. Findley  Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, Mahmud al-Kashgari from the Kara-Khanid Khanate, published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the Compendium of the Turkic Dialects (Ottoman Turkish: Divânü Lügati't-Türk). Soucek     Following the adoption of Islam c. 950 by the Kara-Khanid Khanate and the Seljuq Turks, who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the Ottomans, the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from Arabic and Persian. Turkish literature during the Ottoman period, particularly Ottoman Divan poetry, was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the Ottoman Empire (c. 1299–1922) which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic is termed Ottoman Turkish, that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish known as kaba Türkçe or \"rough Turkish\" spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, which was much purer and which is the basis of the modern Turkish language. Glenny, Misha. The Balkans - Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-1999, Penguin, New York 2001. p. 99.    250px After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey and the script reform, the Turkish Language Association (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents. See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.   By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.  Owing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions.  It is particularly ironic that Atatürk himself, in his lengthy speech to the new Parliament in 1927, used a style of Ottoman diction which today sounds so alien that it has had to be \"translated\" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995. See Lewis (2002): 2–3 for the first two translations.  For the third see      There is also a political dimension to the language debate, with conservative groups tending to use more archaic words in the press or everyday language.  The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance.  However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes—such as bölem to replace fırka, \"political party\"—also failed to meet with popular approval (in fact, fırka has been replaced by the French loanword parti). Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings; for example betik (originally meaning \"book\") is now used to mean \"script\" in computer science.  Many of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts. This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning. For instance, dert, derived from the Persian dard (درد \"pain\"), means \"problem\" or \"trouble\" in Turkish; whereas the native Turkish word ağrı is used for physical pain. Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word, giving rise to a situation similar to the coexistence of Germanic and Romance words in English (see List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents). Among some of the old words that were replaced are terms in geometry, cardinal directions, some months' names, and many nouns and adjectives. Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:     Road sign at the European end of the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul. (Photo taken during the 28th Eurasia Marathon in 2006)  Turkish is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey and by the Turkish diaspora in some 30 other countries. In particular, Turkish-speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly (in whole or part) belonged to the Ottoman Empire, such as Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece (primarily in Western Thrace), the Republic of Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia.    More than two million Turkish speakers live in Germany, and there are significant Turkish-speaking communities in France, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.    Due to the cultural assimilation of Turkish immigrants in host countries, not all ethnic Turkish immigrants speak the language with native fluency.  The number of native speakers in Turkey is about 60 million, corresponding to about 90 percent of the population.  There are roughly another 10 million native speakers worldwide.     Turkish is spoken as a first or second language by almost all of Turkey's residents, with Kurdish making up most of the remainder (about 3,950,000 as estimated in 1980).    However, even most linguistic minorities in Turkey are bilingual, speaking Turkish as a second language to levels of native fluency.    Turkish is the official language of Turkey and is one of the official languages of Cyprus. It also has official (but not primary) status in the Prizren District of Kosovo and several municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia, depending on the concentration of Turkish-speaking local population.  In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the Turkish Language Association (Türk Dil Kurumu or TDK), which was founded in 1932 under the name Türk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti (\"Society for Research on the Turkish Language\"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the ideology of linguistic purism: indeed one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin. The name TDK itself exemplifies this process.  The words tetkik and cemiyet in the original name are both Arabic loanwords (the final -i of cemiyeti being a Turkish possessive suffix); kurum is a native Turkish word based on the verb kurmak, \"set up, found\".   These changes, together with the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet in 1928, shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today. TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the constitution of 1982, following the military coup d'état of 1980.    Map of Turkey Istanbul Turkish is established as the official standard language of Turkey. Dialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s.     Academically, researchers from Turkey often refer to Turkish dialects as ağız or şive, leading to an ambiguity with the linguistic concept of accent, which is also covered with these same words. Projects investigating Turkish dialects are being carried out by several universities, as well as a dedicated work group of the Turkish Language Association.  Work is currently in progress for the compilation and publication of their research as a comprehensive dialect atlas of the Turkish language. Özsoy  The standard dialect of the Turkish language is İstanbul. Rumelice is spoken by immigrants from Rumelia, and includes the distinct dialects of Deliorman, Dinler, and Adakale, which are influenced by the theoretized Balkan linguistic union. Kıbrıs is the name for Cypriot Turkish and is spoken by the Turkish Cypriots. Edirne is the dialect of Edirne. Ege is spoken in the Aegean region, with its usage extending to Antalya. The nomadic Yörük tribes of the Mediterranean Region of Turkey also have their own dialect of Turkish.     This group is not to be confused with the Yuruk nomads of Macedonia, Greece, and European Turkey who speak Balkan Gagauz Turkish.  Güneydoğu is spoken in the southeast, to the east of Mersin. Doğu, a dialect in Eastern Anatolia, has a dialect continuum with Azeri, particularly with Karapapak dialects in some areas. The Central Anatolia region speaks Orta Anadolu. Karadeniz, spoken in the Eastern Black Sea Region and represented primarily by the Trabzon dialect, exhibits substratum influence from Greek in phonology and syntax.    Kastamonu is spoken in Kastamonu and its surrounding areas. The Hemşinli dialect, known as Hemşince, is spoken by the eastern group of Hamshenis around Artvin, influenced by Armenian.    Karamanlıca is spoken in Greece, where it is also named Kαραμανλήδικα (Karamanlidika). It is the literary standard for Karamanlides.     The phoneme  , usually referred to as yumuşak g (\"soft g\"), ğ in Turkish orthography, actually represents a rather weak front-velar or palatal approximant between front vowels. It never occurs at the beginning of a word or a syllable, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.  In native Turkic words, the sounds  ,  , and   are in complementary distribution with  ,  , and  ; the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels.  The distribution of these phonemes is often unpredictable, however, in foreign borrowings and proper nouns.  In such words,  ,  , and   often occur with back vowels: Lewis (2001):3-4,6.  some examples are given below.  When a vowel is added to many nouns ending with postvocalic  , the   becomes   by consonant alternation. A similar alternation applies to certain loan-words ending in    and  , which become   and   , respectively, with the addition of a vowel. The  /  alternation does not usually apply to monosyllabic nouns. Lewis (2001):10.  This is because the final  ,  , and   consonants of these words lose their voicing when not followed by a vowel.     The vowels of the Turkish language are, in their alphabetical order, a, e, ı, i, o, ö, u, and ü.  Undotted   is the close back unrounded vowel  . \"Americans will recognize in it the first vowel of Missouri as pronounced by a native of that state.\"  Lewis (2001):13.   There are no diphthongs in Turkish; when two vowels come together, which occurs rarely and only with loanwords, each vowel retains its individual sound. However, a slight diphthong can occur when two vowels surround a yumuşak g. For example, the word soğuk (\"cold\") can be pronounced /soʊk/ (resembling the English soak) by some speakers.     The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being two-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by two features: front/back and rounded/unrounded.  Vowel harmony is the principle by which a native Turkish word incorporates either exclusively back vowels (a, ı, o, and u) or exclusively front vowels (e, i, ö, and ü).  The pattern of vowels is shown in the table below. Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel.  Grammatical affixes have \"a chameleon-like quality\", Lewis (1953):21  and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony: * twofold (-e/-a): For the terms twofold and fourfold, as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis (1953):21–22.  In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that \"there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped\" (Lewis [2001]:18).  the locative suffix, for example, is -de after front vowels and -da after back vowels.  The notation -de² is a convenient shorthand for this pattern. * fourfold (-i/-ı/-ü/-u): the genitive suffix, for example, is -in or -ın after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and -ün or -un after the corresponding rounded vowels.  In this case, the shorthand notation -in 4  is used.  The following examples, based on the copula -dir 4  (\"[it] is\"), illustrate the principles of vowel harmony in practice: Türkiye'dir (\"it is Turkey\"), In modern Turkish orthography, an apostrophe is used to separate proper names from any suffixes.  kapıdır (\"it is the door\"), bu gündür (\"it is the day\"), paltodur (\"it is the coat\").  There are some exceptions to the rules of vowel harmony.  In compound words, the vowels need not harmonize between the constituent words of the compound.  Forms like bu+gün (\"today\") or baş+kent (\"capital\") are permissible. In addition, vowel harmony does not apply in loanwords and some invariant affixes, such as -yor (present tense) and -bil- (potential).  Some loanwords do, however, exhibit partial or even complete vowel harmony (e.g. mümkün \"possible\"  In Lewis's marvellously precise formulation, \"The effect of vowel harmony extends to non-Turkish words too, bringing as many vowels as possible of a foreign borrowing into one class, or pressing a foreign borrowing whose vowels happen to be all of one class still further into Turkish form.\"  Lewis (2001): 17.   There are also a few native Turkish words that do not follow the rule, such as anne (\"mother\").  In such words, suffixes harmonize with the final vowel: thus annedir (\"she is a mother\").  Many loanwords from Arabic and French, however, take front-vowel suffixes after final back vowels: for example halsiz  4  \"listless\", meçhuldür  4  \"it is unknown\", harfler   * a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: Orta+köy (\"middle village\"—a place name) * a loanword also violating vowel harmony: viyadük (\"viaduct\"  4  harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the k by consonant alternation): viyadüğü    Stress is usually on the last syllable. Handbook of the IPA, p. 155  Exceptions include some suffix combinations and loanwords, particularly from Italian and Greek, as well as many proper names.  While such loanwords are usually stressed on the penultimate syllable (  lokanta \"restaurant\" or   iskele \"quay\"), the stress of proper names is less predictable (  İstanbul,    Ankara).     Turkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes, and specifically suffixes, or endings. This section draws heavily on Lewis (2001) and, to a lesser extent, Lewis (1953).  Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.   One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on Word formation). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word. see Lewis (2001) Ch XIV.  The only native prefixes are alliterative intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example sımsıcak (\"boiling hot\"  \"The prefix, which is accented, is modelled on the first syllable of the simple adjective or adverb but with the substitution of m, p, r, or s for the last consonant of that syllable.\"  Lewis (2001):55.   The prefix retains the first vowel of the base form and thus exhibits a form of reverse vowel harmony.  The extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words. It is jokingly said that the longest Turkish word is Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınız, meaning \"You are said to be one of those that we couldn't manage to convert to a Czechoslovak\".  This example is of course contrived; but long words do frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: Bayramlaşamadıklarımız (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; \"Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings\"). This \"splendid word\" appeared at the time of Bayram, the festival marking the end of the month of fasting.  Lewis (2001):287.  Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (İmlâ Kılavuzu): Dilde birlik, ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir (\"Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a sine qua non of national unity\").  İmlâ Kilavuzu    There is no definite article in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below).  Turkish nouns decline by taking case-endings, as in Latin. There are six noun cases in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand superscript notation.  The plural marker -ler² immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. köylerin \"of the villages\").  The accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare ağaç gördük \"we saw a tree\" with ağacı gördük \"we saw the tree\". Because it is also used for the indefinite accusative, Lewis uses the term \"absolute case\" in preference to \"nominative\".  Lewis (2001):28.   The plural marker -ler² is not used when a class or category is meant: ağaç gördük can equally well mean \"we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]\"—as opposed to ağaçları gördük \"we saw the trees [in question]\".  The declension of ağaç illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant assimilation in suffixes (ağaçtan, ağaçta) and voicing of final consonants before vowels (ağacın, ağaca, ağacı).  Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign person: for example -imiz 4 , \"our\".  With the addition of the copula (for example -im 4 , \"I am\") complete sentences can be formed.  The interrogative particle mi 4  immediately follows the word being questioned: köye mi? \"[going] to the village?\", ağaç mı? \"[is it a] tree?\".  The Turkish personal pronouns in the nominative case are ben (1s), sen (2s), o (3s), biz (1pl), siz (2pl, or formal/polite 2s), and onlar (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: benim (1s gen.); bizim (1pl gen.); bana (1s dat.); sana (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of o use the root on.  All other pronouns (reflexive kendi and so on) are declined regularly.     Two nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:  * definite (possessive) compound (belirtili tamlama).  Eg Türkiye'nin sesi \"the voice of Turkey (radio station)\": the voice belonging to Turkey.  Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending -in 4  added to the first noun; the second noun has the third-person suffix -(s)i 4 .  * indefinite (qualifying) compound (belirtisiz tamlama).  Eg Türkiye Cumhuriyeti \"Turkey-Republic Lewis points out that \"an indefinite izafet group can be turned into intelligible (though not necessarily normal) English by the use of a hyphen\".  Lewis (2001): 42.  = the Republic of Turkey\": not the republic belonging to Turkey, but the Republic that is Turkey.  Here the first noun has no ending; but the second noun has the ending -(s)i 4 —the same as in definite compounds.  The following table illustrates these principles. The examples are taken from Lewis (2001): 41-47.   In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds: these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets].  As the last example shows, the qualifying expression may be a substantival sentence rather than a noun or noun group. The term substantival sentence is Lewis's.  Lewis(2001:257).    Turkish adjectives are not declined. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. güzel (\"beautiful\") → güzeller (\"(the) beautiful ones / people\"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives var (\"existent\") and yok (\"non-existent\") are used in many cases where English would use \"there is\" or \"have\", e.g. süt yok (\"there is no milk\", lit. \"(the) milk (is) non-existent\"); the construction \"noun 1-GEN noun 2-POSS var/yok\" can be translated \"noun 1 has/doesn't have noun 2\"; imparatorun elbisesi yok \"the emperor has no clothes\" (\"(the) emperor-of clothes-his non-existent\"); kedimin ayakkabıları yoktu (\"my cat had no shoes\", lit. \"cat-my-of shoe-plur.-its non-existent-past tense\").     Turkish verbs indicate person. They can be made negative, potential (\"can\"), or impotential (\"cannot\"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show  tense (present, past, inferential, future, and aorist), mood (conditional, imperative, necessitative, and optative), and aspect.  Negation is expressed by the infix -me²- immediately following the stem.  All Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the irregular and defective verb i-, the Turkish copula, which can be used in compound forms (the shortened form is called an enclitic): Gelememişti = Gelememiş idi = Gelememiş + i- + -di.    Turkish verbs have attributive forms, including present (with the ending -en²), future (-ecek²), indirect/inferential past (-miş 4 ), and aorist (-er² or -ir 4 ).  These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns: oynamayan çocuklar \"children who do not play\", oynamayanlar \"those who do not play\"; okur yazar \"reader-writer = literate\", okur yazarlar \"literates\".  The most important function of attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the relative clauses found in most European languages.  The attributive forms used in these constructions are the future (-ecek²) and an older form (-dik 4 ), which covers both present and past meanings. See Lewis (2001):163–165, 260–262 for an exhaustive treatment.   The use of these \"personal or relative participles\" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause. For the terms personal and relative participle see Lewis (1958):98 and Lewis (2001):163 respectively.  Most of the examples are taken from Lewis (2001).    Word order in simple Turkish sentences is generally Subject Object Verb, as in Korean and Latin, but unlike English. In more complex sentences, the basic rule is that the qualifier precedes the qualified: this principle includes, as an important special case, the participial modifiers discussed above.  The definite precedes the indefinite: thus çocuğa hikâyeyi anlattı \"she told the child the story\", but hikâyeyi bir çocuğa anlattı \"she told the story to a child\". Lewis (2001): 239–240.  It is possible to alter the word order to stress the importance of a certain word or phrase. The main rule is that the word before the verb has the stress without exception. For example, if one wants to say \"Hakan went to school\" with a stress on the word \"school\" (okul, the indirect object) it would be \"Hakan okula gitti\". If the stress is to be placed on \"Hakan\" (the subject), it would be \"Okula Hakan gitti\" which means \"it's Hakan who went to school\".     Origin of the words in Turkish vocabulary, which contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin  The 2005 edition of Güncel Türkçe Sözlük, the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin.     Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Arabic, French, Persian, Italian, English, and Greek.    Turkish extensively uses agglutination to form new words from nouns and verbal stems. The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary.  An example set of words derived from a substantive root:  Another example, starting from a verbal root:  New words are also frequently formed by compounding two existing words into a new one, as in German. A few examples of compound words are given below:     Atatürk introducing the new Turkish alphabet to the people of Sinop. September 20, 1928. (Cover of the French L'Illustration magazine)  Turkish is written using a modified version of the Latin alphabet introduced in 1928 by Atatürk to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman Turkish alphabet.    The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels—long ā, ū and ī—and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of z (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has eight vowels.  The reform of the script was an important step in the cultural reforms of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Language Commission composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers.  The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atatürk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.     As a result, there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels. Coulmas, pp. 243–244  Latin was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th century reform. Instances include a 1635 Latin-Albanian dictionary by Frang Bardhi, who also incorporated several sayings in the Turkish language, as an appendix to his work (e.g. alma agatsdan irak duschamas In modern Turkish spelling: elma ağaçtan ırak düşmez.  – 'An apple does not fall far from its tree').  Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely phonetic, with one letter corresponding to each phoneme.  Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being  , which denotes   (  being used for the   found in Persian and European loans);  and the undotted  , representing  .  As in German,   and   represent   and   .  The letter  , in principle, denotes   but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel.  The letters   and   represent   and  , respectively.  A circumflex is written over back vowels following  ,  , or   when these consonants represent  ,  , and  —almost exclusively in Arabic and Persian loans. Lewis (2001):3-7.  Note that in these cases the circumflex conveys information about the preceding consonant rather than the vowel over which it is written.  An apostrophe is used to separate proper nouns from any suffixes: eg İstanbul'da 'in Istanbul'.  The specifically Turkish letters and spellings described above are illustrated in this table:    Dostlar Beni Hatırlasın by Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), a minstrel and highly regarded poet in the Turkish folk literature tradition.    * Turkish alphabet * Turkish folk literature * Turkish Language Olympics * Turkish literature * Turkish Sign Language * List of English words of Turkic origin * List of replaced loanwords in Turkish     Details of the sources cited only by the author's name are given in full in the References section.

      "article:  Uruguay    Uruguay (official full name in  ; pron.  , Eastern Republic of  Uruguay) is a country located in the southeastern part of South America.  It is home to 3.3 million people, of which 1.7 million live in the capital Montevideo and its metropolitan area.  It is bordered by Brazil to the north, by Argentina across the bank of both the Uruguay River to the west and the estuary of Río de la Plata to the southwest, and the South Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is the second smallest independent country in South America, larger only than Suriname and the French overseas department of French Guiana.  Montevideo was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold. Uruguay won its independence in 1828 following a three-way struggle between Spain, Argentina and Brazil. It is a constitutional democracy, where the president fulfills the roles of both head of state and head of government  The economy is largely based in agriculture (making up 10% of the GDP and the most substantial export) and the state-sector, and relies heavily on world trade. Consequently, it is badly affected by any downturn in global prices. However, the economy is on the whole more stable than surrounding states, and it maintains a solid reputation with investors.  According to Transparency International, Uruguay is the second least corrupt country in Latin America (after Chile),  Transparency.org.  with its political and labor conditions being among the freest on the continent.  In November 2007 it became the first Latin American country and the second in the American Continent to recognize same-sex civil unions at the national level.   Uruguay Passes Civil-Union Law at  San Francisco Bay Times (December 6, 2007)  88% of the population are of European descent. Just under two-thirds of the population are declared Roman Catholics. However, the majority of Uruguayans are only nominally religious.  CIA World Factbook -- Uruguay    The name \"Uruguay\" comes from Guaraní. It has many possible meanings. Some of the proposed meanings are: * \"River of the uru\" or \"River of the country of the uru\": a version attributed to Felix de Azara, which suggests that the name of the country comes from a small bird, called the urú, native to the banks of the Uruguay river (from uru, idem, gua, \"place of\", and y, \"water\")  Etimología del Uruguay  * \"River of colorful or 'painted' chinchillas (birds)\": poetic interpretation attributed to Juan Zorrilla de San Martín.  * \"Rivers that have dead people of snails\": an interpretation attributed to a collaborator of Félix de Azara (from arugua, \"snail\", and y, \"water\")  Etimología del Uruguay  * \"River of those who bring food\": an anonymous version which has been popularized since the discovery of an old document written by Jesuit Lucas Marton.     The inhabitants of Uruguay before European colonization of the area were various tribes of hunter gatherer native Americans, the most well known being the Charrúa Indians, a small tribe driven south by the Guaraní Indians of Paraguay. The population is estimated at no more than 5000 to 10000.  /ref>  The Plaza Independencia (\"Independence Square\"), in Montevideo, hosts the tomb of José Artigas, late leader of the Provincia Oriental and the Liga Federal. In front of the square, the Palacio Salvo can be seen. Europeans arrived in the territory of present-day Uruguay in the year 1536, but the absence of gold and silver limited settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries. Uruguay became a zone of contention between the Spanish and the Portuguese empires. In 1603 the Spanish began to introduce cattle, which became a source of wealth in the region.  /ref> The first permanent settlement on the territory of present-day Uruguay was founded by the Spanish in 1624 at Villa Soriano on the south-western coast of the Río Negro. In 1680 the Portuguese built a fort at Colonia del Sacramento.  /ref> Spanish colonization increased as Spain sought to limit Portugal's expansion of Brazil's frontiers.  Another segment of colonial Uruguay's population consisted of people of African descent.  Colonial Uruguay's African community grew in number as its members escaped harsh treatment in Buenos Aires. Many relocated to Montevideo, which had a larger black community, seemed lest hostile politically than Buenos Aires, and had a more favorable climate with lower humidity.  As a province of the Viceroyalty of La Plata, colonial Uruguay was known as the Banda Oriental, or Eastern Strip, referring to its location east of the Rio Uruguay. The inhabitants called themselves \"Easterners\" or \"Orientales\", a term they still commonly use to refer to themselves.  Uruguay's capital, Montevideo, was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold; its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial center competing with Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires. Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing conflicts between the British, Spanish, Portuguese, and colonial forces for dominance in the Argentina-Brazil-Uruguay region.  /ref> In 1806 and 1807, the British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires as part of their war with Spain. As a result, at the beginning of 1807, Montevideo was occupied by a 10,000-strong British force who held it until the middle of the year when they left to attack Buenos Aires.  The Uruguayans' road to independence was much longer than those of other countries in the Americas. Early efforts at attaining independence focused on overthrow of Spanish rule, a process begun by Jose Gervasio Artigas in 1811 when he led his forces to victory against the Spanish in the battle of Las Piedras on May 18, 1811. In 1816, Portuguese troops invaded present-day Uruguay, which led to its eventual annexation by Brazil in 1821 under the provincial name, Provincia Cisplatina.  On April 19, 1825, thirty-three Uruguayan exiles led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja returned from Buenos Aires to lead an insurrection in Uruguay with the help of Argentine troops.  They were known as the \"Treinta y Tres Orientales\".  Their actions inspired representatives from Uruguay to meet in La Florida, a town in the recently liberated area, where they declared independence from Portugal (and therefore Brazil) on August 25, 1825.  Uruguayan independence was not recognized by its neighbors until 1828, when Britain, in search of new commercial markets, brokered peace between Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.  /ref>  Río de la Plata in 1603.     Uruguay's politics takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Uruguay is both head of state and head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the General Assembly of Uruguay. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. For most of Uruguay's history, the Partido Colorado and Partido Blanco have alternated in power. The Partido Blanco has its roots in the countryside and the original settlers of Spanish origin and the cattle ranchers. The Partido Colorado has its roots in the port city of Montevideo, the new immigrants of Italian origin and the backing of foreign interests. The Partido Colorado built a welfare state financed by taxing the cattle revenue and giving state pickles and free services to the new urban immigrants which became dependent of the state. The elections of 2004, however, brought the Frente Amplio, a coalition of socialists, former Tupamaros, former communists and mainly social democrats among others to power with majorities in both houses of parliament and the election of President Tabaré Vázquez by an absolute majority.  The Frente Amplio has displaced the Partido Colorado from its traditional urban welfare state constituency and is enjoying  a boom in export commodity prices.  The Reporters Without Borders worldwide press freedom index has ranked Uruguay as* 57th of 168 reported countries in 2006.  Reporters Without Borders Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2006  According to Freedom House, an American organization that tracks global trends in political freedom, Uruguay ranked twenty-seventh in its \"Freedom in the World\" index. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Uruguay scores a 7.96 on the Democracy Index, located in the last position among the 28 countries considered to be Full Democracies in the world. The report looks at 60 indicators across five categories: Free elections, civil liberties, functioning government, political participation and political culture. The Economist, The world in 2007, A Pause in democracy's march Page 93  Uruguay ranks 28th in the World CPI (Corruption Perception Index) composed by Transparency International.    The Uruguayan constitution allows citizens to challenge laws approved by Parliament by use of a Referendum, or to propose changes to the Constitution by the use of a Plebiscite. During the last 15 years the method has been used several times; to confirm an amnesty to members of the military who violated human rights during the military regime (1973-1985), to stop privatization of public utilities companies (See Economy: Public Sector), to defend pensioners' incomes, and to protect water resources.     At 176,214 square kilometres (68,036 square miles) of continental land and 142,199 square kilometres (54,903 sq mi) of jurisdictional waters and small river islands,  Instituto Nacional Estadistica  Uruguay is the second smallest sovereign nation in South America (after Suriname) and the third smallest territory (French Guiana is the smallest). The landscape features mostly rolling plains and low hill ranges (cuchillas) with a fertile coastal lowland. A dense fluvial network covers the country, consisting of four river basins or deltas; the Río de la Plata, the Uruguay River, the Laguna Merín and the Río Negro. The major internal river is the Río Negro ('black river'). Several lagoons are found along the Atlantic coast. The highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral at 513.66 meters (1,685 ft 3 in) in the 'Sierra de Carapé' mountain range. To the southwest is the Río de la Plata, the estuary of the Uruguay River, which forms the western border, and the Paraná River, that does not run through Uruguay itself.     Uruguay consists of nineteen departments ( , singular  ). The first departments were formed in 1816 and the newest date from 1885 which is Flores. The departments are governed by an intendente municipal who is elected for five years. The members of the Departmental Assembly ( ) form the legislative level of the department.

The predominantly gently undulating landscape is also somewhat vulnerable to rapid changes from weather fronts. It receives the periodic influence of the polar air in winter, and tropical air from Brazil in summer. Without mountains in  zone that act as a barrier, the air masses freely move by the territory, causing abrupt weather changes.  The coolest month is June, while the warmest is January. The rainfall is equally distributed throughout the year, but tends to be a bit more frequent in the autumn months. There can be frequent thunderstorms in the summer. Although snow is not very common, it snowed in 1913, 1918, 1963, 1989, 1992, and 2007.

Montevideo, Uruguay's capital. Uruguay has a middle income economy, mainly dominated by the State services sector, an export-oriented agricultural sector and an industrial sector. Uruguay relies heavily on trade, particularly in agricultural exports, leaving the country particularly vulnerable to slumps in commodity prices and global economic slowdowns. After averaging growth of 5% annually in 1996-1998, in 1999-2001 the economy suffered from lower demand in Argentina and Brazil, which together account for nearly half of Uruguay's exports. Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained stabler than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating — one of only two in South America.

While some parts of the economy appeared to be resilient, the downturn had severe impact on the local population. Unemployment levels rose to more than 20%, real wages fell, the peso devalued. These worsening economic conditions played a part in turning public opinion against the mildly free market economic policies adopted by the previous administrations in the 1990s, leading to the popular rejection of proposals for privatization of the state petroleum company in 2003 and of the state water company in 2004.

(See leaders, President Tabare Vazquez 'On taking office he announced a $100m emergency plan to help the poor '     Agriculture played such an important part in Uruguayan history and national identity until the middle of the twentieth century that the entire country was then sometimes likened to a single huge estancia (agricultural estate) centred around Montevideo, where the wealth generated in the hinterland was spent, at its casco or administrative head.  A heartland of historic estancias: Estancia San Eugenio, Casupá, southern department of Florida. Today, agriculture contributes roughly 10% to the country’s GDP and is still the main foreign exchange earner, putting Uruguay in line with other agricultural exporters like Brazil, Canada and New Zealand. Uruguay is a member of the Cairns Group of exporters of agricultural products. Uruguay’s agriculture has relatively low inputs of labour, technology and capital in comparison with other such countries, which results in comparatively lower yields per hectare but also opens the door for Uruguay to market its products as \"natural\" or \"ecological.\"  Campaigns like “Uruguayan grass-fed beef” and “Uruguay Natural” aim to establish Uruguay as a premium brand in beef, wine and other food products.  Recently, an industry has developed around estancia tourism which capitalizes on the traditional or folkloristic connotations associated with gaucho culture and the remaining resources of Uruguay's historic estancias.     Approximately 88% of its population are of prevalently white European descent: Spaniards, followed closely by Italians, then French, Germans, Portuguese, British, Swiss, Russians, Poles, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, Dutch, Belgians, Croatians, Greeks, Scandinavians, Irish, and Armenians. 0.8% are Mestizo, and the remaining are from Afro-Latin American ancestry.   /ref>   INE, (in Spanish)  Many of the European immigrants arrived in Uruguay in the late 1800s and have heavily influenced the architecture and culture of Montevideo and other major cities. For this reason, Montevideo and life within the city are reminiscent of parts of Europe. For example Barcelona, Thessaloniki or Tel-Aviv are said to be similar to Montevideo in different aspects  /ref>  Some colonies such as Colonia Valdense -a Waldensian colony-, Colonia Suiza -also named Nueva Helvecia- a mainly Swiss colony with some German and Austrian settlers, were founded in the department of Colonia. There are also towns founded by early British settlers, like Conchillas and Barker. A Russian colony called San Javier was found in the department of Río Negro. Mennonite colonies can also be found in the department of Río Negro and in the department of Canelones. One of them, called El Ombú, is famous for its well-known Dulce de Leche \"Claldy\", and is located near the city of Young.  Uruguay has a large urban middle class, and literacy rate of 96.79% (1996 est),   /ref>. During the 1970s and 1980s, an estimated 600,000 Uruguayans emigrated, mainly to Spain, Italy, Argentina and Brazil. Other Uruguayans went to various countries in Europe, to the USA and Australia.  The birth rate is 16.73 births/1000 population.  and Brazil (16.56 births/1,000 population).  /ref>    Uruguay's oldest church is in San Carlos, Maldonado.  Church and state are officially separated since approximately 1916. Most Uruguayans adhere to the Roman Catholic faith (62%), with smaller Protestant (4%) and Jewish (3%), as well as a large nonprofessing group (31%).  Although the majority of Uruguayans do not actively practice a religion, they are nominally church members in the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish communities. It is widely considered the most secular nation in Latin America.     According to data published by the United Nations, the Gini index for Uruguay equals to 44.8 in 2003, where 100 stands for maximum inequality and 0 for even distribution of the wealth between the population.  A recent report compiled and published by the National Statistics Institute      (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica) of Uruguay used 2 indicators to estimate the number of people living in poverty in the country.  *Indigence line: income of the family is not enough for the basic food consumption.  *Poverty line: income of the family is not enough for food consumption, clothing, health and transport.

A view of pedestrian street in the Ciudad Vieja, former Spanish citadel Although rents in neighborhoods not in high demand are not very expensive in Uruguay, it is usually required to have another property as a warranty for the contract, or leave a deposit which many can not afford. This first condition makes renting a property especially difficult for the least favoured sectors of the population. According to the INE 23, 3% of the population lives in a place neither owned nor rented. Some of them are proper built houses, but others are precarious constructions built illegally in public or private empty land just outside the cities. Thus, whole new poor neighborhoods have emerged in the last decades. They are called Asentamientos or more colloquially Cantegriles in ironic allusion to the fashionable Neighborhood of Cantegril in Punta del Este.  The phenomena is similar to the Favelas in Brazil,  Villas Miseria in Argentina, Barrios in Venezuela, Arrabales in Spain, Poblaciones Callampa in Chile or Jacales in Mexico.    The main sport in Uruguay is football. The Uruguay national football team is one of only five nations to win the FIFA World Cup on two or more occasions. In 1930, Uruguay hosted the first ever World Cup and went on to win the competition, defeating Argentina 4-2 in the final. Uruguay won the 1950 FIFA World Cup as well, famously defeating the favored hosts, Brazil, 2-1 in the final. Uruguay is by far the smallest country, population wise, to win a World Cup. Out of the World Cup winners, the nation with the second smallest population is Argentina (winners of the 1978 and 1986 editions) who currently have just over 40,000,000 people according to the latest estimate; the 2002 census has Uruguay's current population slightly under 3,400,000. The Uruguay national team has also won the Copa América 14 different times, a record it shares with Argentina.  Basketball, rugby union, and tennis are other popular sports in Uruguay.    ;Political and economic rankings :GDP per capita - 60 th  highest, at I$11,969 :Human Development Index - 43 rd  high, at 0.851 :Income Equality -
